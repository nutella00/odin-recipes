    <h1>Spicy Sweet Potato Baked Fries</h1>
    <h4>This recipe is easy to double-up if you're serving more than two people.</h4>
    <h6>Ingredients</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced into 1cm (½in) thick fries</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp sea salt pinch of ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Instructions</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C</li>
        <li>In a large bowl combine the sweet potato fries and sunflower oil.</li>
        <li>In a smaller bowl, mix together the smoked paprika, garlic powder, sea salt and cinnamon. Toss this through the sweet potato until all the fries are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Spread out evenly over two baking trays, making sure that none of the fries are overlapping - this will ensure that they cook evenly and become crisp. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes until golden brown and crisp at the edges. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The spice mix can be mixed and stored in an airtight jar for up to 4 weeks - why not use it to spice up jacket potatoes?</p>
